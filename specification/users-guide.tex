The encoder expects a data signal with a corresponding clock. It outputs two data signals, I and Q, and a corresponding clock.

Likewise the decoder expects two input signals, I and Q, and a corresponding clock. It outputs a pair of signals (one for audio and one for video) consisting of data and clock.
